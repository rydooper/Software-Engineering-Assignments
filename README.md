# Software-Engineering-Assignments

Code from each assignment for the Year 2 Software Engineering Module (2020-21). Each branch represents a different assignment and I worked on both assignment 1 and 2 with a partner - Luke Aldred.

Assignment 2 involved refactoring code to improve code quality. As we refactored the code into an object oriented method, we also edited the Boost UTF tests provided. This assignment also involved using Jenkins (a continuous integration server) to monitor regressions/new commits to the github repo.
