# Software-Engineering-Assignments

Code from each assignment for the Year 2 Software Engineering Module (2020-21). Each branch represents a different assignment and I worked on both assignment 1 and 2 with a partner - Luke Aldred.


Assignment 1 involved implementing a series of C++ functions that would parse and interpret GPS data from a text file. This is to ensure that they are in NMEA (National Marine Electronics Association) standard.
If correctly implemented, the functions would (and do) pass all of the Boost UTF tests given.
